Just checkin, if anything goes wrong u hit my phone ok?
Iâ€™ll be fine, and back this evening
Still canâ€™t realize Iâ€™ll have to stay here for the next 3 weeks..
Istg Iâ€™ll find the mf who broke my leg and make him pay
Everythingâ€™s fine??
Yes Sean.. I didnâ€™t even get to town
Itâ€™s dead silent out there
I dont like that :/
This bastardâ€™s still there thoðŸ’€
[photo dâ€™un zombie mort sous une roue]
Lol too bad we canâ€™t use this car anymore
I will try to focus on the road k? Iâ€™ll text u when I reach the bridge
Shit- ok, be careful
Um tell me- can I take one of your cigs? Im stressing the hell out
Np haha
I have the city in front
Remember where Brat lives?
406 E Central Blvd, got it
Iâ€™ll try negociate a pack of luckies with this rat
Stay on the highway till E Pine street
Wait a sec
Thereâ€™s a lurker 5 cars ahead
Ok leave. Weâ€™ll find another way
Keep the last bullet
Tell me youâ€™re safe
I am
omg ty
Do u want the bad or the good news?
WHAT stop playing
IM FINE
But I had to use our bullet
Heâ€™s dead?
Yes
Its alright then.
And STOP with the lurker thingðŸ’€
We say zombie, everyone says zombie, youâ€™re not in the walking dead dumbass
[GIF fuck your bad vibesÂ»]
Your sense of humorâ€™s unbreakable huh
We survived much worse things
Still got my blade
Yea..
Hurry up then, go get these provisions
Later brother
Were the doors condemned last time?
There are two large planks on them
Maybe he took precautions for the first time in his life
Iâ€™ll go in by the yard
Did you eat btw?
Iâ€™m not hungry at all.. itâ€™ll save us food
Youâ€™re too hard with yourself, Iâ€™ll bring food this afternoon anyway
Guess what
The bean cans are moldy-
Brat better sells decent food to us this time
U good??
Sorry
Iâ€™m in and its.. odd
Smells like rot
Remind me the floor real quick
8th
I doubt itâ€™s a good idea Dan
Would be a shame to turn around rn
WOULD BE A SHAME IF YOU DIED TOO
Can you please let me do what I need to do
If I wasnâ€™t here weâ€™d run out of food in a couple days
Wait. I will find him
U serious?
Dont be mad im just worried
Dan?
Answer me pls
We have a problem
Gosh youâ€™re here
[Photo de Brat suicidÃ© avec son fusil]
What

Its really bad
Get out
Wait, I wonâ€™t leave behind what Iâ€™m here for
And itâ€™s free
Iâ€™m gonna kill youðŸ’€
What were you writing?

Sounds in the staircase
Im hidden in a closet
Did you pick up a gun or something??
Didnâ€™t have the time
Theyâ€™re here
